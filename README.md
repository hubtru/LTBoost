# LTBoost: Boosted Hybrids of Ensemble Linear and Gradient Algorithms for the Long-term Time Series Forecasting

This repository is the official Pytorch implementation of [LTBoost](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3627673.3679527) (CIKM24). 
This code is based on the code bases of LTSF-Linear and Autoformer. 


## LTBoost Hybrid model

LTBoost employs an effective boosted hybrid strategy that combines a simple one-layer linear model with multiple non-linear, tree-based gradient boosting ensembles. 

First, the one-layer linear model forecasts multivariate time series by leveraging both intra-channel and inter-channel information. Afterwards, multiple LightGBM univariate-forecasting models are conditioned on the residual errors of the linear model. This approach combines the strengths of the linear model and the gradient boosting trees. In this way the multivariate input capability of LTBoost allows for capturing both long-term inter-channel dependencies and intra-channel interactions.



Below, one can see a depiction of LTBoost's training regime.

### LTSF-Linear

LTSF-Linear is a set of linear models that outperform Transformers.

- **Linear**: A one-layer linear model.
- **NLinear**: A one-layer linear model with input normalization to handle distribution shifts in the dataset. 
- **DLinear**: Two one-layer linear models. One layer predicts the trend component (derived by a moving average kernel) and the other layer predicts the remainder (seasonal) component.  

LTSF-Linear models are highly efficient in terms of memory and speed, offer interpretability, and deliver competitive forecasting accuracy. Although these models benefit from GPU utilization, a GPU is not required for their operation.

### LightGBM

[LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a robust gradient boosting framework that provides decision tree-based machine learning algorithms suitable for a wide range of tasks. Notably efficient on CPUs, LightGBM stands as a compelling alternative to other boosting frameworks such as XGBoost. It distinguishes itself by employing a leaf-wise tree growing strategy, gradient-based one-side sampling, and exclusive feature bundling. Frequently a top contender in data science competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/prashant111/lightgbm-classifier-in-python), LightGBM is especially prevalent in time series forecasting competitions, consistently ranking among the best models.


We deeply appreciate the contributions of the LightGBM project which is licensed under the MIT license, whose code we have incorporated into our files. The original work can be found at [LightGBM GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/).

## Comparison of Multivariate Forecasting Performance

We evaluated the performance of LTBoost on nine established benchmark datasets against 13 recent models and a vector autoregression (VAR) baseline. Each model was tested on four forecasting horizons. LTBoost demonstrated superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in 32 out of 36 cases, representing more than 88% of the cases when evaluated by mean absolute error (MAE). Regarding mean squared error (MSE), LTBoost outperformed other models in 23 of 36 cases, accounting for more than 63%.

The **detailed performance comparison** is presented in **Table 3**, where the best results are highlighted in bold, the secondbest results are marked with double underline, and the third-best results with one underline. Lower MAE and MSE values indicate better performance, clearly showcasing LTBoost’s leading accuracy across a broad range of conditions and metrics.

### Drop_last=False
In accordance with the best practices outlined by  ([Qiu *et al.*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.20150)), we used `drop_last=False`. This adjustment ensures that the last incomplete batches are not discarded during evaluation. This clarification corrects our statement in the original paper where we **mistakenly** noted that we dropped the last batch.

## Getting Started
### Environment Requirements

First, please make sure you have installed Conda. Then, our environment can be installed by:
```
conda create -n LTBoost python=3.9
conda activate LTBoost
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation

You can obtain all the nine benchmarks from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy) provided by Autoformer. The datasets are already pre-processed and easy-to-use.

Create a **dataset** directory:
```
mkdir dataset
```
**Please put them in the `./dataset` directory**


### How to run LTBoost
We provide forecasting script files in `./scripts/EXP-LongForecasting`:
| Directory | Interpretation                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Linear    | Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) using Linear models |
| LTBoost   | LTSF using LTBoost                                           |


To train the **LTBoost** model on the **ILI dataset**, you can use the script `scripts/EXP-LongForecasting/LTBoost/ili.sh`:
```
sh scripts/EXP-LongForecasting/LTBoost/ili.sh
```

Similarly for **LTSF-Linear**, you can use:
```
sh scripts/EXP-LongForecasting/Linear/ili.sh
```
Please note that the name of the linear model (Linear, DLinear, NLinear) can be specified in the script and is NLinear by default.

After running any script, the results can be found in `logs/LongForecasting`.


### Ablation Study
To rerun the ablation study described in the paper, you can use the script `scripts/Ablation/ablation.sh`: 
```
sh scripts/Ablation/ablation.sh
```
After running the script, the results can be found in `logs/Ablation`.
The ablation study takes some time to run since several models will be trained.


## LTBoost Colab Demo
We additionally provide the following easy-to-use colab notebooks to showcase **LTBoost**.

## Interpretability

LTBoost is designed to provide excellent interpretability. Both components of LTBoost, the linear model and the LightGBM ensembles, are inherently interpretable. This design choice allows researchers to derive insights that can aid in model development and understanding.

### Weight Visualization
As described by the authors of [LTSF-Linear](https://github.com/cure-lab/LTSF-Linear), the weights of the linear models and the linear component of LTBoost can be easily visualized using our adapted version of `weight_plot.py`. Simply add the model path (or model name) to the script and run it to generate the visualizations, which will be saved in a `weights_plot` directory.


### Feature Importance
Tree-based methods like those utilized by LightGBM allow for straightforward quantification of feature importance through the average gain of features. This capability not only enhances the interpretability of the model but also provides valuable insights into the decision-making processes of our LightGBM ensembles.

### Example
To illustrate, we trained LTBoost on the ETTh1 dataset using a look-back window of 96 and a forecasting length of 96. Below, you can view the weights of LTBoost's linear component as well as the feature importance from two LightGBM models within LTBoost's tree component.

The [Influenza-like Illness (ILI)](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html) dataset encapsulates the weekly incidence rates of influenza-like illness reported by seven Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) across the United States. Spanning from 2002 to 2021, this dataset aggregates a total of 966 weekly observations, offering a comprehensive view of ILI trends over nearly two decades.

The dataset is particularly notable for its detailed breakdown of ILI cases, categorizing data according to patient age groups and the reporting healthcare providers, among other variates. Such granularity enables nuanced analyses of ILI spread patterns, potentially aiding in the development of targeted public health responses.
